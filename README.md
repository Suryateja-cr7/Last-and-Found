# Last-and-Found
I have developed a user-friendly mobile application called "Lost and Found" that serves as a platform connecting individuals who have found lost items with their rightful owners. The app aims to simplify the process of reuniting lost items with their owners by providing intuitive features.

One of the key functionalities of the app is the ability for users to submit detailed information about found items. This feature enables finders to provide accurate descriptions and relevant details of the discovered items, increasing the chances of successful reunions.

Additionally, the application includes a feature that allows users to capture and upload descriptions of their lost items. By facilitating the easy documentation of lost belongings, the app enhances the chances of finding and retrieving these items.

Overall, the Lost and Found app streamlines the process of reuniting lost items with their owners through its user-friendly interface and features for submitting found item details and capturing descriptions of lost items.
